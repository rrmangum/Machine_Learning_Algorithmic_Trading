The original model had an accuracy score of 49% and consistently performed better than the actual returns.

Step 6: Adjusting the size of the training dataset to only include data from May 2018 and forward 
turned the strategy from profitable, to an overall loss. However, the accuracy of the model increased from 49% to 55%. While this model is technically more accurate at prediciting the outcomes than the original, this strategy overall returns less than the original model.


Step 7: This alternative model is using the original dataset, but altered the short SMA window to 20 and the model increased in accuracy from 49% to 51%, however this model also flipped the strategy from profitable to unprofitable.

The original model prudced the best strategy returns from the tested models.
